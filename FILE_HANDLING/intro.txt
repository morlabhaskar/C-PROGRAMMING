→ fopen()

FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);

* fopen function search for a given file in secondary memory, if found it loads the file from the secondary memory, and create a file control structure variable to it and returns the address of the file control structure variable.

→ fclose()

int fclose(FILE *stream);

* Closes the file associated with stream. Returns 0 on success, EOF on error.

→ fgetc()

int fgetc(FILE *stream);

* Reads the next character from the given file stream and returns it as an unsigned char cast to an int. Returns EOF on end-of-file or error.

→ fputc()

int fputc(int c, FILE *stream);

* Writes the character c (converted to an unsigned char) to the file stream. Returns the written character, or EOF on error.

→ fgets()

char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream);

* Reads a string from the file stream, stopping after n-1 characters or a newline, whichever comes first. The string is null-terminated. Returns str on success or NULL on error or EOF.

→ fread()

size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);

* Reads data from the file into an array pointed to by ptr. It reads up to nmemb items of size bytes each. Returns the number of items successfully read.

→ fwrite()

size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);

* Writes data from the array ptr to the file. Writes nmemb items of size bytes each. Returns the number of items successfully written.

→ fscanf()

int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);

* Reads formatted input from a file (similar to scanf). Returns the number of input items successfully matched and assigned.

→ fprintf()

int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);

* Writes formatted output to a file (similar to printf). Returns the number of characters printed, or a negative value on error.

→ ftell()

long ftell(FILE *stream);

* Returns the current file position indicator (offset in bytes from the beginning of the file). Returns -1L on error.

→ fseek()

int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);

* Moves the file position indicator to a specific location: whence can be SEEK_SET (beginning), SEEK_CUR (current position), or SEEK_END (end). Returns 0 on success, nonzero on failure.

→ frewind()

void rewind(FILE *stream);

* Sets the file position indicator to the beginning of the file (equivalent to fseek(stream, 0, SEEK_SET)) and clears any error/EOF flags.
