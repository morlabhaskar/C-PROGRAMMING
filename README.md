# C Programming Practice for Embedded Systems

This repository contains C programs written to strengthen my **programming fundamentals** and prepare for **embedded systems development**.  
It serves as a personal practice space for exploring **low-level programming**, **memory management**, and **hardware-oriented logic**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The main objectives of this repository are to:
- Build a **strong foundation in C language**
- Practice **problem-solving** with a focus on embedded systems
- Understand **low-level concepts** like pointers, bitwise operations, and memory handling
- Get comfortable with **hardware-related coding patterns**
- Prepare for **microcontroller programming** and **embedded firmware development**

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
This repository will include:
- **Basic Programs** â€“ Loops, conditionals, functions
- **Pointer Mastery** â€“ Pointer arithmetic, pointer to functions
- **Bitwise Operations** â€“ Masking, shifting, setting/clearing bits
- **Memory Management** â€“ Static, dynamic, and volatile usage
- **Data Structures** â€“ Arrays, structures, linked lists in C
- **Hardware-Oriented Logic** â€“ Simulated I/O control, register manipulation (mock)
- **File Handling** â€“ For logging and debugging
- **Algorithm Practice** â€“ Sorting, searching, and optimization

## ðŸ›  Tools & Requirements
- **Compiler**: GCC / ARM GCC for cross-compiling
- **IDE/Editor**: VS Code, Keil uVision, or any preferred text editor
- **OS**: Windows / Linux
- (Optional) **Simulator/Debugger**: QEMU, Proteus, or microcontroller IDE
